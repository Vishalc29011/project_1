## TITLE: 
Coronavirus Probability Detector.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION: 
 As we know that the whole world is affected by the coronavirus. In this we have make a “Coronavirus Probability Detector” using python and machine learning concepts. This project is very different yet helpful for all of us in such a pandemic situation. 

## PREREQUISITES: 
Any web browser.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
Visual Studio Code, Python.

## OUTCOMES:
•	Detects the COVID-19infection probability according to patient’s symptoms
•	Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.
•	 The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.




## OBJECTIVES: 
•	A sample set of parameters is as follow:
1.	Average Fever-Continous
2.	Body Pain-0/1 Binary
3.	Age-Discrete
4.	Runny Nose
5.	Breathing Problem- Categorical: 0/1/-1
•	 Detects probability easily.
•	To make it easier to calculateq the infection probability at any time and any place.



## Conclusion:
This machine learning model is trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the COVID-19 infection.
